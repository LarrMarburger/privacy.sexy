## Get started

- Online version: [https://privacy.sexy](https://privacy.sexy)
  - or download latest desktop version for [Windows](https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy.sexy/releases/download/0.8.2/privacy.sexy-Setup-0.8.2.exe), [Linux](https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy.sexy/releases/download/0.8.2/privacy.sexy-0.8.2.AppImage), [macOS](https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy.sexy/releases/download/0.8.2/privacy.sexy-0.8.2.dmg)
- üí° Come back regularly to apply latest version for stronger privacy and security.

## Why

- Rich tweak pool to harden security & privacy of the OS and other software on it
- Free (both free as in beer and free as in speech)
- No need to run any compiled software that has access to your system, just run the generated scripts
- Have full visibility into what the tweaks do as you enable them
- Ability to revert (undo) applied scripts
- Everything is transparent: both application and its infrastructure are open-source and automated
- Easily extendable

## Extend scripts

1. Fork the repository
2. Add more scripts in respective script collection in [collections](src/application/collections/) folder.
   - üìñ If you're unsure about the syntax you can refer to the [collection files | documentation](docs/collection-files.md).
   - üôè For any new script, please add `revertCode` and `docs` values if possible.
3. Send a pull request üëå

## Commands

- Project setup: `npm install`
- Testing
  - Run unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
  - Lint: `npm run lint`
- **Desktop app**
  - Development: `npm run electron:serve`
  - Production: `npm run electron:build` to build an executable
- **Webpage**
  - Development: `npm run serve` to compile & hot-reload for development.
  - Production: `npm run build` to prepare files for distribution.
  - Or run using Docker:
    1. Build: `docker build -t undergroundwires/privacy.sexy:0.8.2 .`
    2. Run: `docker run -it -p 8080:80 --rm --name privacy.sexy-0.8.2 undergroundwires/privacy.sexy:0.8.2`

## Architecture

### Application

- Powered by **TypeScript**, **Vue.js** and **Electron** üí™
  - and driven by **Domain-driven design**, **Event-driven architecture**, **Data-driven programming** concepts.
- Application uses highly decoupled models & services in different DDD layers.
  - **Domain layer** is where the application is modelled with validation logic.
  - **Presentation Layer**
    - Consists of Vue.js components and other UI-related code.
    - Desktop application is created using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).
    - Event driven as in components simply listens to events from the state and act accordingly.
  - **Application Layer**
    - Keeps the application state using [state pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern)
    - [ApplicationContext](src/application/Context/ApplicationContext.ts)
      - Holds the [CategoryCollectionState](src/application/Context/State/CategoryCollectionState.ts)] for each OS
      - Same instance is shared throughout the application
    - The scripts are defined and controlled in [yaml files](src/application/collections/) per OS
      - Uses [data-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_programming)
      - üìñ See [extend scripts](#extend-scripts) to read about how to extend them.

### AWS Infrastructure

[![AWS solution](img/architecture/aws-solution.png)](https://github.com/undergroundwires/aws-static-site-with-cd)

- It uses infrastructure from the following repository: [aws-static-site-with-cd](https://github.com/undergroundwires/aws-static-site-with-cd)
  - Runs on AWS 100% serverless and automatically provisioned using [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/).
  - Maximum security & automation and minimum AWS costs are the highest priorities of the design.

#### GitOps: CI/CD to AWS

- CI/CD is fully automated for this repo using different GIT events & GitHub actions.
  - Versioning, tagging, creation of `CHANGELOG.md` and releasing is automated using [bump-everywhere](https://github.com/undergroundwires/bump-everywhere) action
- Everything that's merged in the master goes directly to production.
