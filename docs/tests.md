# Tests

- There are two different types of tests executed:
  1. [Unit tests](#unit-tests)
  2. [Integration tests](#integration-tests)
  3. [End-to-end (E2E) tests](#e2e-tests)
- All tests
  - Uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/).
  - Are written in files that includes `.spec` extension.
- ðŸ’¡ You can use path/module alias `@/tests` in import statements.

## Unit tests

- Tests each component in isolation.
- Defined in [`./tests/unit`](./../tests/unit).
- They follow same folder structure as [`./src`](./../src).

### Naming

- Each test suite first describe the system under test.
  - E.g. tests for class `Application` is categorized under `Application`.
- Tests for specific methods are categorized under method name (if applicable).
  - E.g. test for `run()` is categorized under `run`.

### Act, arrange, assert

- Tests use act, arrange and assert (AAA) pattern when applicable.
- **Arrange**
  - Should set up the test case.
  - Starts with comment line `// arrange`.
- **Act**
  - Should cover the main thing to be tested.
  - Starts with comment line `// act`.
- **Assert**
  - Should elicit some sort of response.
  - Starts with comment line `// assert`.

### Stubs

- Stubs are defined in [`./tests/stubs`](./../tests/unit/stubs).
- They implement dummy behavior to be functional.

## Integration tests

- Tests functionality of a component in combination with others (not isolated).
- Ensure dependencies to third parties work as expected.
- Defined in [`./tests/integration`](./../tests/integration).

## E2E tests

- Test the functionality and performance of a running application.
- E2E tests are configured by vue plugin [`e2e-cypress`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/packages/@vue/cli-plugin-e2e-cypress#readme) for Vue CLI.
- Names and folders are structured logically based on tests.
- The structure is following:
  - [`cypress.json`](./../cypress.json): Cypress configuration file.
  - [`./tests/e2e/`](./../tests/e2e/): Base Cypress folder.
    - [`/specs/`](./../tests/e2e/specs/): Test files, test are named with `.spec.js` extension.
    - [`/plugins/index.js`](./../tests/e2e/plugins/index.js): Plugin file executed before project is loaded.
    - [`/support/index.js`](./../tests/e2e/support/index.js): Support file, runs before every single spec file.
    - *(Ignored)* `/videos`: Asset folder for videos taken during tests.
    - *(Ignored)* `/screenshots`: Asset folder for Screenshots taken during tests.
