  1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
  2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
  3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
  4. Ensure the test suite passes.
  5. Make sure your code lints.

## Guidelines

### Handle the state in presentation layer

- There are two types of components:
  - **Stateless**, extends `Vue`
  - **Stateful**, extends [`StatefulVue`](./src/presentation/StatefulVue.ts)
    - The source of truth for the state lies in application layer ([`./src/application/`](src/application/)) and must be updated from the views if they're mutating the state
    - They mutate or/and react to state changes in [ApplicationContext](src/application/Context/ApplicationContext.ts).
    - You can react by getting the state and listening to it and update the view accordingly in [`mounted()`](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#mounted) method.
